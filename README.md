# NLP Knowledge Graph Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow for extracting entities and relationships from scientific text and representing them in a knowledge graph. The pipeline includes:
- Text preprocessing
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Knowledge graph construction
- Graph pruning
- Visualization using Matplotlib/NetworkX
- Exporting processed graphs for downstream use
